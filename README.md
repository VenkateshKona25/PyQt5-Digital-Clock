PyQt5 Digital Clock
This project is a simple yet elegant digital clock application built using PyQt5. It displays the current time and date in a visually appealing format with green text on a black background. The time updates every second using a QTimer, and the layout is managed with QVBoxLayout to ensure proper alignment and responsiveness.
The clock shows the time in hh:mm:ss AP format and the date in dd MMM yy format. Both labels are centered, with the time prominently displayed in a large font and the date shown below in a smaller font. The application window is sized to provide a clear and readable interface.
To run this project, you need Python 3 and the PyQt5 library installed. You can install PyQt5 using pip:
pip install PyQt5

Once installed, simply run the script using:
python digital_clock.py

This project is ideal for beginners looking to explore PyQt5 or for anyone who wants a lightweight desktop clock. You can customize the font, colors, and formats easily by modifying the stylesheet and format strings in the code.
